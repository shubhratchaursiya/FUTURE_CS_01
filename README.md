## 📖 Task Overview
This task focuses on performing a basic vulnerability assessment on a legally permitted live website. The objective is to identify common web security vulnerabilities, classify their risk levels, and provide clear remediation recommendations using simple and professional language.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this assessment is to:
- Identify security vulnerabilities in a live web application  
- Analyze and classify risks as Low, Medium, or High  
- Recommend appropriate remediation steps  
- Gain real-world experience in vulnerability assessment and professional security reporting  

---

## 🌐 Scope of Assessment
- **Website Tested:** https://testphp.vulnweb.com  
- **Testing Type:** Basic & Passive Security Testing  
- **Assessment Coverage:**
  - Web application vulnerabilities  
  - Security misconfigurations  
  - Information disclosure issues  

⚠️ No intrusive or harmful testing was performed.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Nmap** – Network and port scanning  
- **OWASP ZAP (Passive Mode)** – Web vulnerability detection  
- **Browser Developer Tools** – HTTP header and client-side analysis  
- **Canva** – Professional report design  
- **GitHub** – Documentation and submission  

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Selected a legally permitted test website  
2. Performed Nmap scanning to identify open ports  
3. Used OWASP ZAP in passive mode to analyze traffic  
4. Inspected HTTP headers using browser developer tools  
5. Identified security vulnerabilities  
6. Classified risks based on severity  
7. Documented findings with remediation steps
